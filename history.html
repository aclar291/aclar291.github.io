        <p id="paragraph1">Line dancing's origins in the United States are not entirely known, 
        however many of the steps and dances seen today were brought to the US 
        by European immigrants in the 19th century. Between the 1860s and 1890s, 
        country-western line dancing appeared. By the mid-20th century, line dancing
        was a popular choice for physical education classes. As the years passed,
        line dancing enjoyed a steady growth in popularity, notably with songs like 
        Achy Breaky Heart by Billy Ray Cyrus catching the public's eye. With the 
        advent of the Digital Age, line dancing has been in the spotlight more than 
        ever before. It's all over TikTok, dontcha know?</p>
